## Yes, Your Applications are Under Attack: Protecting each step of the development lifecycle

Your developer supply chain is constantly under attack, from the download of vulnerable components, to the licensing and governance of those components, all the way through monitoring their use in the production environment. In this workshop/lecture, Maury Cupitt will look at each phase of the development lifecycle and show how to protect each of those phases using the Nexus Platform.
